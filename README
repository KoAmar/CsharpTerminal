I wrote this serial data program in C# so that I could compare it to the one I wrote in Python 3.5.

I wrote TERMINAL.CS and SERIAL_RX_TX.CS on Windows 10 in Visual Studio 2017.

These two modules show you how to use serial COM ports on Windows 10 to do the following:

- send and receive lines of text terminated with \n
- handle received data with your own event-handler
- send lines of text at regular intervals from a file file
 
All Visual Studio 2017 project files are included.
